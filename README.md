### Reflections and Comments

#### Lab 11
    This lab felt like I was pulling all of the fundamentals from lab 10 and using them in a slightly different way. Last week DOM manipulation seemed like a daunting task to me, and now it flows effortlessly. Organizing all of the html elements is becoming secondhand as well. It didn't take long to put the page together. It was exciting putting together the event handling and getting the clicks to add "votes" to each image. I had some extra time after getting everything to function properly, so I went ahead and started styling the page using grid layout to match the wireframe asset provided. I hope that's not incorrect to do. Overall this went really well and it feels good to be understanding some of these concepts even better. It took me about 7 hours to complete this assignment, which is about how long I thought it would take.
